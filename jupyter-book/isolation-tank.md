# The Isolation Tank and Floatation Tank

I have always loved the isolation tank because it is meditation that works. 

My websites related to the isolation tank are:
* [The Deep Self](http://www.thedeepself.org) - the metaphysics of isolation and the isolation tank
* Isolation Tank Gnosis is a religion based around the isolation tank. It was formed after I spent 5 weeks floating in isolation and doing nothing else. You may read [the holy book of the religion](https://pressbooks.pub/isolationtankgnosis/) as well as visit [the main site](http://git.thedeepself.org/about/).
